"Ziprasidone Augmentation of SSRI Antidepressants in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Pilot Study of Augmentation Therapy","Background Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is often a chronic, disabling illness for which antidepressant medications (ie, SSRI) are considered the primary psychopharmacological treatment. However, many patients remain refractory to antidepressants alone or in combination with psychotherapy. Safe and effective treatments for individuals with refractory PTSD are needed. This study aimed to examine ziprasidone augmentation of SSRI treatment of PTSD. Methods This was a 2-phase study. In phase 1, subjects were treated with paroxetine or sertraline for 8 weeks. Individuals refractory to the SSRI treatment then entered into phase II of the study and were randomized, in a double-blind fashion, to 8 weeks of treatment with either ziprasidone or placebo. The primary outcome measure was change in Clinician Administered PTSD Scale total scores with the intent-to-treat sample. Secondary outcome measures included Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores, measures of depression and anxiety, and safety measures. Results No significant differences were observed on the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, or other outcome measures between ziprasidone and placebo groups. No significant differences were observed for safety measures including metabolic profiles, extrapyramidal symptoms/movement disorder rating scales, nor study dropout. Conclusions Although no significant differences were noted in efficacy or safety measures between ziprasidone and placebo in this pilot study, the small sample size prevents definitive conclusions.",546,Exclude,2019,Article,Intervention
"World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) guidelines for treatment of anxiety, obsessive-compulsive and posttraumatic stress disorders–Version 3. Part II: OCD and PTSD","Aim: This is the third version of the guideline of the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) Task Force for the Pharmacological Treatment of Anxiety, Obsessive–Compulsive and Posttraumatic Stress Disorders which was published in 2002 and revised in 2008. Method: A consensus panel of 34 international experts representing 22 countries developed recommendations based on efficacy and acceptability of the treatments. In this version, not only medications but also psychotherapies and other non-pharmacological interventions were evaluated, applying the same rigorous methods that are standard for the assessment of medication treatments. Result: The present paper (Part II) contains recommendations based on published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for the treatment of OCD (n = 291) and PTSD (n = 234) in children, adolescents, and adults. The accompanying paper (Part I) contains the recommendations for the treatment of anxiety disorders. For OCD, first-line treatments are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Internet-CBT was also superior to active controls. Several second-line medications are available, including clomipramine. For treatment-resistant cases, several options are available, including augmentation of SSRI treatment with antipsychotics and other drugs. Other non-pharmacological treatments, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), deep brain stimulation (DBS) and others were also evaluated. For PTSD, SSRIs and the SNRI venlafaxine are first-line treatments. CBT is the psychotherapy modality with the best body of evidence. For treatment-unresponsive patients, augmentation of SSRI treatment with antipsychotics may be an option. Conclusion: OCD and PTSD can be effectively treated with CBT and medications.",545,Exclude,2023,Article,Review
"World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) guidelines for treatment of anxiety, obsessive-compulsive and posttraumatic stress disorders–Version 3.

"World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of anxiety, obsessive-compulsive and post-traumatic stress disorders - First revision","In this report, which is an update of a guideline published in 2002 (Bandelow et al. 2002, World J Biol Psychiatry 3:171), recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are presented. Since the publication of the first version of this guideline, a substantial number of new randomized controlled studies of anxiolytics have been published. In particular, more relapse prevention studies are now available that show sustained efficacy of anxiolytic drugs. The recommendations, developed by the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) Task Force for the Pharmacological Treatment of Anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive and Post-traumatic Stress Disorders, a consensus panel of 30 international experts, are now based on 510 published randomized, placebo- or comparator-controlled clinical studies (RCTs) and 130 open studies and case reports. First-line treatments for these disorders are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and the calcium channel modulator pregabalin. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are equally effective for some disorders, but many are less well tolerated than the SSRIs/SNRIs. In treatment-resistant cases, benzodiazepines may be used when the patient does not have a history of substance abuse disorders. Potential treatment options for patients unresponsive to standard treatments are described in this overview. Although these guidelines focus on medications, non-pharmacological were also considered. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and other variants of behaviour therapy have been sufficiently investigated in controlled studies in patients with anxiety disorders, OCD, and PTSD to support them being recommended either alone or in combination with the above medicines.",543,Exclude,2008,Article,Review
Withdrawal symptoms of benzodiazepines in panic disorder patients' pharmacotherapy,"[Purpose] This study compared the withdrawal symptoms of long-acting benzodiazepine (ethyl loflazepate; loflazepate) with those of short-acting benzodiazepine (alprazolam) in combined pharmacotherapy with fluvoxamine (FLV) to treat panic disorder patients. [Methods] The subjects were thirty-two patients meeting the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for panic disorder. All subjects were outpatients at the Department of Neuropsychiatry, Osaka City University Medical School Hospital. All subjects gave informed consent to participate in this study. The subjects were allocated into two groups; FLV and loflazepate group (n=16) or FLV and alprazolam group (n=16). Based on clinical status, FLV was gradually increased to 150 mg/day and then remained constant for 20 weeks of the trial. The dosages for benzodiazepines (BZs) were increased from 1 to 2 mg/day for loflazepate, and from 0.8 to 1.6 mg/day for alprazolam. After 12 weeks, the respective BZ was gradually reduced by 0.5 mg/day (loflazepate) or 0.4 mg/day (alprazolam) every 2 weeks, then discontinued. To evaluate symptoms of panic disorder, efficacy and side effects, Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A), Sheehan Disability Scale were used. To evaluate safety and withdrawal symptoms during the tapering of benzodiazepines, the Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Symptom Questionnaire (BWSQ) was used. [Results] Either combination therapy using FLV with loflazepate or alprazolam was effective in the treatment of patients with panic disorder. However, patients treated with FLV and long-acting loflazepate had significantly fewer withdrawal symptoms than patients treated with FLV and short-acting alprazolam. [Conclusions] In combined pharmacotherapy for patients with panic disorder, longer-acting loflazepate combined with FLV had the same effects on the symptoms of panic disorder and fewer withdrawal symptoms than shorter-acting alprazolam during tapering and after discontinuation of BZs. These findings suggested that longer-acting BZs are better suited to the treatment of patients with panic disorder with combined pharmacotherapy using FLV and BZs.",541,Exclude,2009,Article,Disease
"Why psychiatric drugs ""work"": The attribution of positive effects due to psychological factors","While outcome research has attempted to elucidate the real benefit of any treatment through randomized, double-blind studies, the role of placebo and other psychological reactions has been given scant but growing attention. This article examines the nature and power of the placebo in the context of antidepressant therapy. Other factors influencing patient reports of positive response are considered, including emotional blunting, victimization, and rebound. It is concluded that the attribution of healing properties to antidepressant drugs is complex and multifaceted, and that the modest advantage of these drugs over placebo may well derive from psychological, not physiological, factors. © 2008 Springer Publishing Company.",540,Exclude,2008,Article,Review
Where are we going with SSRIs?,"During the past decade the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRls) have become established as the treatment of choice for depression. As newer antidepressants become available on the market, it is important to reappraise the position of the SSRIs in the management of depression. This review will address the question: where are we going with the SSRIs? The continued establishment of the SSRIs as first-line treatment for depression will be discussed, focusing on the more rapid onset of antidepressant efficacy seen with pindolol augmentation and the use of SSRIs for treatment of depression in patients with physical illnesses, particularly ischaemic heart disease. The SSRIs have well-documented efficacy in panic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and paroxetine has recently been licensed for social anxiety disorder/social phobia in some countries. Results will be presented from studies with the SSRIs in new therapeutic areas, including post-traumatic stress disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.

When do you prescribe antidepressants to depressed children? Topical collection on mood disorders,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) in children and adolescents is a public health problem that requires evidence-based management. Our objective is to review available studies, with a PubMed search, and briefly summarize safety and efficacy results of (mostly SSRI) antidepressants in children and adolescents with MDD. Fluoxetine and escitalopram are safe and effective in the treatment of MDD in children and adolescents both in reduction of symptoms, and in remission/response rates. However, response rates are lower than for non-OCD anxiety. Sertraline also had positive results in one study that pooled results from two studies. The number needed to treat (NNT) for MDD is 10, and the number needed to harm (NNH) for suicidality is 112. Methodological limitations in the studies include, mainly, high placebo response rates, associated with multiple study sites, younger patients, and lower MDD severity. Treatment should be maintained close to 1 year after remission, to prevent relapse. FDA-approved fluoxetine and escitalopram are safe and effective in the treatment of pediatric MDD. Sertraline also has some data supporting its efficacy and safety, but is not FDA-approved. The possible modest increase in suicidal ideation in some patients should be known by clinicians, but the risk/benefit ratio is 1 to 11.2 times favorable to using SSRIs in moderate to severe MDD. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",538,Exclude,2013,Article,Review
WCA Recommendations for the Long-Term Treatment of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common and disabling condition. In addition to combat-related PTSD, the disorder occurs in civilians exposed to severe traumatic events, with the community prevalence rate for the combined populations reaching as high as 12%. If left untreated, PTSD may continue for years after the stressor event, resulting in severe functional and emotional impairment and a dramatic reduction in quality of life, with negative economic consequences for both the sufferer and society as a whole. Although PTSD is often overlooked, diagnosis is relatively straight-forward once a triggering stressor event and the triad of persistent symptoms-reexperiencing the traumatic event, avoiding stimuli associated with the trauma, and hyperarousal-have been identified. However, comorbid conditions of anxiety and depression frequently hamper accurate diagnosis. Treatment for PTSD includes psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. The latter includes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Only SSRIs have been proven effective and safe in long-term randomized controlled trials. Current guidelines from the Expert Consensus Panel for PTSD recommend treatment of chronic PTSD for a minimum of 12-24 months.",537,Exclude,2003,Conference Paper,Review
War trauma and PTSD in Ukraine's civilian population: comparing urban-dwelling to internally displaced persons,"INTRODUCTION: War in Ukraine started in March 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea and continues today in the Donbass region of Eastern Ukraine. Over 1.5 million people in these regions have been displaced from their homes. We conducted this study 36 months after the conflict began and interviewed civilians residing in Ukraine. PURPOSE: This study examines the prevalence of exposure to war trauma, rates of PTSD by symptom clusters, and whether socio-demographic factors are associated with positive scores for PTSD among civilian urban-dwelling and internally displaced persons in Ukraine during the ongoing conflict in its Donbass region. METHODS: Face-to-face interviews were conducted using a multi-stage random sample of the general population in two large cities (Kharkiv and Lviv) in Ukraine (n = 1247) and a purposive sample of internally displaced persons (n = 300), half living in each city. Exposure to trauma, symptom clusters for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and overall PTSD were assessed. RESULTS: We found widespread direct exposure to conflict-related traumatic events (65%) among internally displaced people (IDPs) compared to a sizable minority (23%) of urban-dwelling people (UDPs). We found elevated prevalence of PTSD symptoms that were also uniformly spread within several socio-demographic factors. There were, however, significant differences in PTSD between (1) IDPs compared to UDPs and (2) those UDPs with Ukrainian compared to Russian ethnic identity, the former of each pair showing increased likelihoods of positive PTSD scores. CONCLUSIONS: Ukraine's adult civilians, enduring the prolonged engagement in war with Russia and Russian separatists, have elevated rates of PTSD. Moreover, those who have been displaced by the ongoing conflict (IDPs) have significantly higher levels of PTSD compared to UDPs.",536,Exclude,2022,Article,Study design
Visual hallucinations associated with varenicline: A case report,"Introduction. Varenicline is widely used for smoking cessation. It has shown efficacy over placebo and bupropion in manufacturer-sponsored trials. Those with mental illness were excluded from these trials. There are case reports of exacerbation of mental illness and development of psychiatric symptoms with varenicline use. Case presentation. A 61-year-old male Caucasian being treated for post-traumatic stress disorder, depression not otherwise specified and alcohol dependence, was prescribed varenicline while he was in a post-traumatic stress disorder/alcohol dual diagnosis treatment program. He developed visual hallucinations, which became worse with titration of the medication. These symptoms resolved upon discontinuation of varenicline. Conclusion. Patients with mental illness have a higher incidence of nicotine dependence, and attempts should be made for smoking cessation. Varenicline has not been widely tested in this population. There are reports of exacerbation of mental illness, and probable causation of psychiatric symptoms in the mentally ill. Providers should be aware of this possibility and advise their patients appropriately. © 2009 licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",535,Exclude,2009,Article,Study design
Virtual reality and psychedelics for the treatment of psychiatric disease: A systematic literature review,"Objective: Hallucinogenic substances or psychedelic drugs have been historically used by humans worldwide for centuries, and interest grows around them because of the therapeutic potential that they pose for mental disease. Virtual Reality (VR), has been highly developed and improved in the last decade, and it is also gaining importance due to their potential as therapeutic tools. In this article, the most recent and relevant information regarding the medical applications of both VR and psychedelics was highlighted, and diverse potential therapeutic uses were explored in hope to set the ground for further research on this topic. Method: A systematic literature review using the PRISMAmethods was conducted in PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus and Web of Science, including only peer-reviewed clinical trials or case studies written in English, that address the use of psychedelics and/or VR for the treatment of psychiatric disorders and that measure the success of the therapies. A final selection of 23 manuscripts were used in this systematic review. Results: VR showed security and significant efficacy in the management of special cases of phobias (social, motion pain and spiders), eating disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), gambling disorder, preoperative anxiety and schizophrenia. Conclusions: The hallucinogenic drugs evaluated exhibited positive effects in treatment of depressive and anxiety disorders, alcohol dependence and PTSD. More research is needed in order to test the effectiveness of these therapies (alone or together) in different mental illnesses and different populations.",534,Exclude,2020,Article,Review
Vintage treatments for PTSD: A reconsideration of tricyclic drugs,"Serotonin (SSRI) and serotonin-norepinephrine (SNRI) reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are the first-line recommended drug treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); but despite their benefits, much residual pathology remains and no new drugs have yet emerged with a clearly demonstrated benefit for treating the disorder. A case is made that tricyclic drugs deserve a closer look, based on their ability to affect several of the main neurotransmitters that are relevant to PTSD. Their promising efficacy, which was shown 30 years ago, had not been followed up, until a recent trial of desipramine found advantages over a SSRI in PTSD with comorbid alcohol dependence. Opportunities exist for studying newer and purportedly safer tricyclic formulations, as well as further the work with older, established compounds. A reappraisal of their risk:benefit ratio seems in order, when treating PTSD.",533,Exclude,2015,Article,Review
"Venlafaxine XR for major depressive disorder after spinal cord injury: Rationale, results, and recommendations","Objective: To examine the efficacy and tolerability of venlafaxine XR (VFNXR) for major depressive disorder (MDD) in people with SCI. Design: Multisite, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Subjects were block randomized and stratified by site, prior history of MDD, and lifetime history of substance dependence. Participants/Methods: Participants were recruited from outpatient clinics at 6 SCI treatment centers. Subjects were 18-64, at least 1 month SCI, with DSM-IV MDD or dysthymic disorder and no suicidal intent or plan. The primary outcome was the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) at 12 weeks. Results: A total of 2,536 people were screened, 133 were randomized, and 126 (95%) were retained. Participants were on average 40 years old, 47% had cervical injuries, and 53% had AIS A SCI. Common comorbidities were chronic pain (94%), substance dependence (47%), and PTSD (48%). Mixed model regression revealed no significant differences between the VFNXR and placebo groups on improvement in depression severity (HAM-D) from baseline to 12 weeks. There was a nonsignificant trend for a larger proportion of people with a history of substance dependence to achieve remission on VFNXR (50%) compared to placebo (25%; P = .06), an effect that was statistically significant among completers (P = .048). Conclusions: Future research should examine the efficacy of alternative treatments (eg, behavior activation, cognitive therapy, physical activity), combined treatment, or intensified treatment approaches. VFNXR may be an effective antidepressant for certain SCI subgroups.",532,Exclude,2013,Conference Abstract,Disease
Venlafaxine XR for depression and pain in spinal cord injury: Major outcomes,"Background: Depression and pain aremajor sources of suffering in people with spinal cord injury (SCI). Effective treatments for these conditions are lacking. We wanted to determine whether venlafaxine XR (VFNXR) is an effective treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) or pain in SCI. Design: We conducted a 12-week, 1:1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of VFNXR in people with SCI and MDD. The trial was conducted at six SCI centers in the US. Primary outcomes were the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and 0-10 numerical rating scale of pain intensity measured at baseline 1, 3, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks. Methods: We screened 2536 people, randomized 133 (69 to VFNXR vs. 64 to placebo) and retained 126 (95%) at 12 weeks. Sample characteristics: 74% male, mean age 40 years, 57% non-Hispanic white, 53% AIS A, and 53% had paraplegia. High prevalence comorbidities included chronic pain (93%), probable post-traumatic stress disorder (48%) and marijuana use (32%). The primary analysis was intent-to-treat and used a mixed model regression comparing improvement in depression severity in the two groups while controlling for stratification variables and any confounders. Results: Randomization was effective. The effects of VFNXR and placebo on depression severity were equivalent (mean HAM-D = 9.5 (7.3) in the VFNXR group vs. 9.5 (6.5) in the placebo group. Analysis of self-report depression measures and completers analyses yielded similar results. Pains were divided into neuropathic versus non-neuropathic based on pain characteristics. Decreases in pain were greater in the VFNXR group versus control group for non-neuropathic pain (P = 0.013) but not for neuropathic pain. Half of those on VFNXR demonstrated at least a 50% reduction in pain severity from baseline to 12 weeks, compared to only 28% in the placebo group (P = 0.016). Conclusions: VFNXR is not more effective than placebo as a treatment for MDD after SCI. However, VFNXR did result in statistically and clinically significant reductions in non-neuropathic pain compared to placebo in people with SCI and MDD.",531,Exclude,2013,Conference Abstract,Disease

Venlafaxine in the treatment of atypical facial pain: A randomized controlled trial,"Aims: To study in a randomized placebo-controlled design the efficacy of the antidepressant venlafaxine, a serotonin and a weak noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, in the treatment of atypical facial pain (AFP). Methods: The study was a randomized, double-blind, crossover comparison of venlafaxine and a placebo. It consisted of 2 treatment periods, each of 4 weeks' duration, separated by a 2-week washout period. Thirty patients suffering from chronic pain who had been diagnosed with AFP after a thorough clinical examination were recruited. Pain intensity and pain relief were registered at 6 visits. Anxiety, depression, and adverse effects were recorded. Venous blood samples were collected at the end of each treatment period for the determination of serum levels of venlafaxine and its metabolites. Results: Twenty patients completed the trial. Eight patients discontinued because of adverse effects and 2 patients were excluded because of noncompliance. Two patients completed the trial but were excluded from the analysis because they experienced no pain at the baseline visit. There was no significant difference in pain intensity reduction between the maximum tolerated dose of venlafaxine (75 mg in most cases) and the placebo. Pain relief was significantly greater with venlafaxine than with the placebo treatment. Significantly more escape medication was consumed during the placebo period compared with the venlafaxine period. No significant correlation was found between the serum concentration of the drug and the response to treatment. Anxiety and depression scores did not differ between venlafaxine and placebo treatment. Adverse effects were equally common during both treatments. Conclusion: Venlafaxine was only modestly effective in the treatment of AFP.",529,Exclude,2004,Article,Disease

Venlafaxine extended release (XR) for the prophylaxis of migraine and tension-type headache: A retrospective study in a clinical setting,"Objective. - To assess the efficacy of extended-release venlafaxine in the prophylaxis of migraine and chronic tension-type headache. Background. - Venlafaxine, a structurally novel antidepressant, is a selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. This study is the first to test the effects of extended-release venlafaxine on headaches. Methods. - Patients were evaluated on a retrospective basis. Fifty-six patients with chronic tension-type headache and 114 patients with migraine were prescribed extended-release venlafaxine. Nearly all the study subjects had been resistant to several previous preventive medications. Patients took venlafaxine for an average of 6 months with a median dose of 150 mg (range, 37.5 to 300 mg). Results. - The mean frequency of headaches in the group with chronic tension-type headache fell from 24.0 to 15.2 per month (P<.0001). The group with migraine showed a reduction from 16.1 to 11.1 headaches per month (P<.0001). The medicine was well tolerated. Conclusions. - This trial indicates that extended-release venlafaxine has potential in headache prophylaxis based on its efficacy and safety profile. We recommend a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to further assess the role of extended-release venlafaxine in headache prevention.",526,Exclude,2000,Article,Study design
VE-MMODE – A randomized controlled trial of Venlafaxine versus Escitalopram for treatment of mild to moderate depression in persons with epilepsy,"Objectives: Depression in persons with epilepsy (PWE) goes undiagnosed and untreated. Despite being common, there are no direct efficacy comparisons of available antidepressants in PWE. Our aim was to compare the effectiveness of Venlafaxine (VEN) and Escitalopram (ESCIT) in comorbid depression in PWE. Methods: In a single-center, prospective, double-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) 90 PWE (age ?18 years) with mild to moderate depression, were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive ESCIT (5–20 mg/day) or VEN (37.5–150 mg/day) for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was to study differences in the efficacy, based on the change in scores of the Hamilton depression rating scale (HAM-D) at 8 weeks. Seizure frequency, QOLIE-31, adverse event profile, and medication adherence were secondary outcome measures. Results: Using the NDDI-E scale, we screened 350 PWE, 90 were enrolled. ITT analysis included all participants and the PP analysis included 40 participants to VEN group and 42 to ESCIT group. Baseline mean (±SD) HAM-D scores for both groups were similar (13.53 ± 3.27; 13.02 ± 3.57). The mean difference (95%CI) on HAM-D scores at 8 weeks was found to be significant within both groups (ITT/PP- VEN: 7.75(6.75, 8.79)/7.92 (7.06, 8.78); p < 0.001, ESCIT: 8.21 (7.39, 9.03)/8.23(7.43, 9.04); p < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in the efficacy of VEN versus ESCIT at 8 weeks. A significant improvement in QOLIE-31 index and seizure frequency was observed from baseline in both the groups. 90% of those on VEN and 92.9% of those using ESCIT adhered to the treatment at week 8. Adverse events were more in VEN group than the ESCIT group. Conclusions: This study found that HAMD scores improved significantly in the ESCIT and VEN groups, despite the fact that there was no clinically meaningful difference observed between the two groups. Trials with a larger sample size and longer duration are required to establish whether ESCIT or VEN is superior.",525,Exclude,2023,Article,Disease
"Varenicline augmentation in depressed smokers: An 8-week, open-label study","Objective: To assess possible antidepressant effects of varenicline augmentation in outpatients with treatment-resistant depressive disorders and nicotine dependence. Background: Varenicline is a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ?4?2 partial agonist and ?7 full agonist approved for smoking cessation. Studies of similar compounds have suggested evidence of antidepressant effects. Method: Eighteen patients (aged 18 to 65 years) were recruited from a general psychiatric outpatient clinic. Inclusion criteria were (1) primary Axis I depressive disorder (DSM-IV-TR criteria), (2) a stable antidepressant or mood stabilizer regimen, (3) persistent depressive symptoms despite adequate treatment, and (4) current cigarette smoking with nicotine dependence. Patients received varenicline (started at 0.5 mg daily and titrated to 1 mg twice daily) in addition to stable doses of their regular psychotropic medications. Depression symptoms, side effects, clinical global impressions, anhedonia, daily cigarette consumption, and vital signs were assessed every 2 weeks for 8 weeks. Baseline and endpoint ratings were compared, and the relationship between mood improvement and smoking cessation was examined. The primary outcome variable was mean change score in depressive symptoms as assessed by the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self- Report. The study was conducted between September 2007 and March 2008. Results: Fourteen patients (78%) completed the study; 4 discontinued due to side effects, including gastrointestinal effects (n = 3) and worsened mood/irritability (n = 1). Patients demonstrated significant improvement in depression at end point (p < .001), with significant improvement as early as week 2. Eight patients (44%) met criteria for categorical response, and 6 (33%) reached remission criteria; the overall effect size was large. All patients were interested in smoking cessation: 8 (44%) achieved abstinence and 9 (50%) had some reduction in smoking. Improvement in depressive symptoms was correlated with smoking cessation. There was no evidence of treatment-emergent suicidality. Conclusion: Open-label varenicline augmentation was associated with significant improvement in mood in a small sample of outpatient smokers with persistent depressive symptoms. Larger, double-blind studies are needed to investigate potential antidepressant effects of varenicline augmentation.

Validation of the massachusetts general hospital Antidepressant Treatment History Questionnaire (ATRQ),"The low rate of response to antidepressants in treatment resistant depression (TRD) justifies studies of next-step therapies following a treatment failure. In TRD clinical trials, it is important to verify the accurate diagnosis of treatment resistance for all enrolled subjects using a reliable and valid instrument. Self-rated scales can reduce the impact of investigator bias and reduce the time burden for clinical researchers. The Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire (ATRQ) is a self-rated scale used to determine treatment resistance in major depressive disorder (MDD). The ADAPT-A study is a multi-center double-blind, placebo-controlled study of low-dose aripiprazole adjunctive to ADT among outpatients with TRD. At the screening assessment, potential subjects completed the MGH ATRQ. The ADAPT-A medical monitors subsequently performed remote patient interviews and obtained detailed medication histories. The data obtained from the MGH ATRQ and by the medical monitors were compared for congruency. Of the 186 patients enrolled by the local sites, no subjects deemed treatment resistant by the MGH ATRQ were found to be nonresistant by the medical monitors. In 76.3% (n = 142) of the subjects, the number of failed adequate antidepressant trials reported by the MGH ATRQ was concordant with the data collected by medical monitors. In 16.1% (n = 30) of all cases, the medical monitors found a greater number of failed trials; in 7.5% (n = 14) of cases, the medical monitors found fewer failed medication trials. The discrepancy was by more than one medication trial in only 4.0% (n = 7) of cases. We found the MGH ATRQ to be relatively concordant in its assessment of treatment resistance in depression compared with independent clinical researchers. Although the MGH ATRQ tended to underreport the number of unsuccessful treatment trials relative to the clinical interviews, its accuracy in cases it detected was confirmed by raters. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",523,Exclude,2010,Article,Study design
Validation and clinical application of the Metacognitions Questionnaire in a sample of Brazilian generalized anxiety disorder patients: the effects of different treatment interventions,"Introduction: Metacognitive beliefs about worry may trigger anxiety. However, the effect of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) treatment on metacognition has not yet been investigated. Objectives: To validate the Metacognitions Questionnaire (MCQ-30) in a Brazilian GAD sample and verify whether different interventions reduce metacognitive beliefs. Method: We recruited 180 GAD individuals and randomized them to Body in Mind Training (BMT), Fluoxetine (FLX), or an active control group (Quality of Life [QoL]) for 8 weeks. The MCQ-30 was assessed for internal consistency, was evaluated with confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses, and was tested for convergent validity with the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ). Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were employed to analyze differences after the interventions. Results: The MCQ-30 demonstrated good internal consistency and acceptability; the original five-factor model was supported. There was a positive moderate correlation between MCQ-30 scores and worry. GEE showed a significant group x time interaction (p < 0.001). Both BMT (mean difference [MD] =-6.04, standard error [SE] =-2.39, p = 0.034) and FLX (MD =-5.78, SE = 1.91, p = 0.007) reduced MCQ-30 scores. FLX was superior to QoL, but not BMT, at weeks 5 and 8. There were no differences between BMT and QoL. Conclusion: The Brazilian-Portuguese version of MCQ-30 showed good psychometric properties. Furthermore, the positive effect of FLX and BMT on metacognition suggests it may represent a potential therapeutic target.",522,Exclude,2023,Article,Disease
"Utilization of prescription medications and medications labelled for suicide risk among veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar affective disorder, major affective disorder and/or schizophrenia in a pragmatic randomized trial","OBJECTIVES: To describe the prescription drug utilization of 243 Veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or major affective disorder who both enrolled and completed at least 2 assessments for a pragmatic randomized trial of blister packaging versus dispensing as usual of all prescribed medications in Denver, Colorado between 2012 and 2014. The intervention was designed to improve adherence and reduce suicide risk. METHODS: Trial records were linked to VHA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) prescription fill records for the study period by unique patient ID. This study was reviewed and approved by the VISNs 2 and 19 Human Subjects Review Boards and the Department of Defense Human Research Protections Office. RESULTS: 236 (97.1%) of these Veterans filled at least one prescription for a tablet or capsule drug product at the VA outpatient pharmacy while enrolled in the study. Subjects were enrolled for a mean of 9.4 months during which time they filled a total of 5,939 tablet and capsule prescriptions. The most prevalent drug classes were antidepressants (CN609) (17%) and anticonvulsants (CN400) (12%). The most frequent drug products dispensed were trazodone (6%), sertraline (5%), prazosin (5%), omepra-zole (4%), and gabapentin (4%). CONCLUSIONS: This pragmatic randomized trial was designed to improve medication adherence among Veterans who may be at elevated risk of suicide or overdose due to schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, for example. Both are associated with increased risk of suicide. The most prevalenet prescription medications in this pragmatic trial were antidepressants and antic-onvulsants, all of which are labelled for risk of suicidal ideation and behavior. Further examination of combination prescribing refinement of warning labels for suicide risk may support future adherence and prevention efforts. LIMITATIONS: Prescription fills outside of VA were not observed.",521,Exclude,2017,Conference Abstract,Study design
Using actigraphy to measure the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on night-to-night variability in awakenings,"Introduction: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been associated with various sleep disturbances, including increased awakenings. However, studies have typically employed polysomnography to examine this relationship. Actigraphy affords the benefit of collecting information over a longer duration, allowing for the observation of nightly variation in sleep parameters. Methods: Twenty-four subjects with posttraumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder (63% male; M = 51.95, SD = 10.20) wore actigraphs over a period of one week. Approximately one-third of these patients were prescribed SSRIs, including citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline. These cross-sectional data were analyzed using ANOVA techniques. Results: There were significant differences between individuals who were and were not taking SSRIs. Individuals prescribed SSRIs were more likely to have an increase in the night-to-night variability in the frequency of awakenings F(1,21) = 7.117 (P = 0.02), and a tendency towards more nightly variability in the percentage of time spent awake in bed F(1,21) = 4.159 (P = 0.06). As expected, individuals who received SSRIs had more frequent awakenings F(1,23) = 7.553 (P = 0.01), more wake time after sleep onset F(1,23) = 4.634 (P = 0.04), and a trend towards a higher percentage of time spent awake in bed F(1,23) = 3.299 (P = 0.08). Conclusion: Interestingly, SSRIs were associated with an increase in both the nightly variability of awakenings and percentage of time spent awake. Patients on SSRIs also experienced a greater number of awakenings, and spent (on average) more time awake than those not on SSRIs. These results extend and confirm polysomnography findings showing that SSRI use contributes to fragmented sleep. From a behavioral perspective, SSRIs may additionally hinder patients' abilities to establish a routine sleep/wake pattern.",519,Exclude,2010,Conference Abstract,Study design
Use of Antiepileptic Drugs for Nonepileptic Conditions: Psychiatric Disorders and Chronic Pain,"Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are commonly utilized for nonepileptic conditions, including various psychiatric disorders and pain syndromes. Evidence for their benefit in these nonepileptic conditions varies widely among different drugs, but there is, in general, a paucity of published multicenter randomized double-blind trials. Variable levels of evidence suggest that lamotrigine and the vagal nerve stimulator have antidepressant properties. Carbamazepine, valproate, lamotrigine, and oxcarbazepine appear to have mood stabilizing properties while gabapentin, pregabalin, and tiagabine have anxiolytic benefits. Barbiturates, topiramate, and possibly phenytoin may precipitate or exacerbate depression. Underlying depression and anxiety symptoms may be exacerbated by levetiracetam, while psychotic symptoms have rarely been reported with topiramate, levetiracetam, and zonisamide. Pregabalin, gabapentin, carbamazepine, and oxcarbazepine have been used to treat neuropathic pain such as postherpetic neuralgia, and diabetic polyneuropathy. Topiramate and divalproex sodium have utility in the prophylaxis or acute treatment of migraine. Further rigorous studies are needed to clarify the utility of AEDs in nonepileptic conditions. © 2007 The American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics, Inc.",517,Exclude,2007,Article,Language
Treatment-resistant anxiety disorders: A literature review of drug therapy strategies,"Anxiety disorders are widespread psychiatric conditions with significant social and professional disability, poor quality of life, an increased risk of suicide, and frequent attendance of medical services. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRI) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) have demonstrated a rather robust efficacy for the treatment of most of anxiety disorders. Nevertheless a substantial number of patients are resistant or still suffer from residual symptoms despite this first line treatment. The objective of our paper is to review relevant studies for the pharmacologic management of anxiety disorders resistant to the first line treatment. For this purpose, we conducted a pubmed/medline search for double-blind placebo-controlled trials of treatment-resistant anxiety disorders. An adequate trial for a SRI in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) should continue for at least 12 weeks. Special considerations of the comorbidities and symptom profile could help in the choice of an appropriate pharmacotherapy. Several trials have highlighted the efficacy of antipsychotics as an add-on to SRI in treatment-resistant OCD such as haloperidol more so when comorbid with a tic disorder, or risperidone that can reduce OCD as well as depressive symptoms. Aripiprazole has been shown efficacious in two placebo-controlled double-blind trials, while the efficacy of quetiapine and olanzapine remains controversial. Other trials showed some efficacy of anticonvulsants (lamotrigine, topiramate), pindolol, memantin and N-acetylcystein as an adjunctive treatment to SRI for resistant OCD. Few trials have investigated selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or SNRI resistant generalized anxiety disorder showing a failure of adjunctive therapy with olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone and risperidone. These studies were underpowered and very limited in number. Adjunctive risperidone for resistant post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) showed benefit in some but not all trials. Olanzapine was beneficial for the reduction of the CAPS score in addition to the improvement of sleep disturbances. Furthermore, prazosin was efficacious by reducing PTSD symptoms, sleep disturbances, nightmares, and psychological distress. One double-blind placebo-controlled study was conducted to investigate treatment-resistant social phobia showing no benefit of pindolol add-on paroxetine. Our results demonstrate that the pharmacological management of treatment-resistant anxiety disorders is not sufficiently investigated in double-blind placebo-controlled trials, despite a growing evidence in favor of antipsychotics and some other pharmacological agents in resistant OCD and, to a lesser extent, PTSD. Hence, there is a crucial need for larger double-blind placebo-controlled trials for resistant anxiety disorders. Finally, being out of the scope of our review, we omitted studies of non-pharmacologic therapies.",515,Exclude,2015,Article,Review
Treatment-refractory posttraumatic stress disorder (TRPTSD): a review and framework for the future,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious psychiatric consequence of trauma that occurs in a proportion of individuals exposed to life-threatening events. Trauma-focused psychotherapy is often recommended as first choice for those who do not recover spontaneously. But many individuals require medications. In the US, only paroxetine (PRX) and sertraline (SRT) are FDA approved for PTSD. But response and remission rates with these medications are low, so numerous other pharmacologic interventions have been tried. To date, there has not been a systematic review of the data on what are the best next-step pharmacologic strategies for individuals who fail standard treatments. To that end, we review 168 published trials of medications other than PRX or SRT and provide a detailed analysis of the 88/168 studies that describe alternative pharmacologic interventions in patients refractory to other treatment. We also review clinical factors relevant to treatment-refractory PTSD; the neurobiology of extinction, as well as evidence-based psychotherapy and neuromodulation strategies for this condition.",514,Exclude,2016,Article,Review
Treatment of sleep disturbances in posttraumatic stress disorder: A review,"Sleep disturbances are among the most commonly reported posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. It is essential to conduct a careful assessment of the presenting sleep disturbance to select the optimal available treatment. Cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBTs) are at least as effective as pharmacologic treatment in the short-term and more enduring in their beneficial effects. Cognitive-behavioral treatment for insomnia and imagery rehearsal therapy have been developed to specifically treat insomnia and nightmares and offer promise for more effective relief of these very distressing symptoms. Pharmacotherapy continues to be an important treatment choice for PTSD sleep disturbances as an adjunct to CBT, when CBT is ineffective or not available, or when the patient declines CBT. Great need exists for more investigation into the effectiveness of specific pharmacologic agents for PTSD sleep disturbances and the dissemination of the findings to prescribers. The studies of prazosin and the findings of its effectiveness for PTSD sleep disturbance are examples of studies of pharmacologic agents needed in this area. Despite the progress made in developing more specific treatments for sleep disturbances in PTSD, insomnia and nightmares may not fully resolve.",510,Exclude,2012,Article,Review
Treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder nightmares at a veterans affairs medical center,"The effectiveness of medications for PTSD in general has been well studied, but the effectiveness of medicatio.ns prescribed specifically for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) nightmares is less well known. This retrospective chart review examined the efficacy of various medications used in actual treatment of PTSD nightmares at one Veteran Affairs Hospital. Records at the Salem, VA Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) were examined from 2009 to 2013 to check for the efficacy of actual treatments used in comparis.on with treatments suggested in three main review articles. The final sample consisted of 327 patients and 478 separate medication trials involving 21 individual medications plus 13 different medication combinations. The three most frequently utilized medications were prazosin (107 trials), risperidone (81 trials), and quetiapine (72 trials). Five medications had 20 or more trials with successful results (partial to full nightmare cessation) in >50% of trials: risperidone (77%, 1.0–6.0 mg), clonidine (63%, 0.1–2.0 mg), quetiapine (50%, 12.5–800.0 mg), mirtazapine (50%; 7.5–30.0 mg), and terazosin (64%, 50.0–300.0 mg). Notably, olanzapine (2.5–10.0) was successful (full remission) in all five prescription trials in five separate patients. Based on the clinical results, the use of risperidone, clonidine, terazosin, and olanzapine warrants additional investigation in clinically controlled trials as medications prescribed specifically for PTSD nightmares.",508,Exclude,2016,Article,Study design
Treatment of narcolepsy and other hypersomnias of central origin: An American Academy of Sleep Medicine review,"Objective: The purpose of this paper is to summarize current knowledge about treatment of narcolepsy and other hypersomnias of central origin. Methods: The task force performed a systematic and comprehensive review of the relevant literature and graded the evidence using the Oxford grading system. This paper discusses the strengths and limitations of the available evidence regarding treatment of these conditions, and summarizes key information about safety of these medications. Our findings provide the foundation for development of evidence-based practice parameters on this topic by the Standards of Practice Committee of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Results: The majority of recent papers in this field provide information about use of modafinil or sodium oxybate for treatment of sleepiness associated with narcolepsy. Several large randomized, placebo-controlled studies indicate that modafinil and sodium oxybate are effective for treatment of hypersomnia due to narcolepsy. We identified no studies that report direct comparison of these newer medications versus traditional stimulants, or that indicate what proportion of patients treated initially with these medications require transition to traditional stimulants or to combination therapy to achieve adequate alertness. As with the traditional stimulants, modafinil and sodium oxybate provide, at best, only moderate improvement in alertness rather than full restoration of alertness in patients with narcolepsy. Several large randomized placebo-controlled studies demonstrate that sodium oxybate is effective for treatment of cataplexy associated with narcolepsy, and earlier studies provide limited data to support the effectiveness of fluoxetine and tricyclic antidepressants for treatment of cataplexy. Our findings indicate that very few reports provide information regarding treatment of special populations such as children, older adults, and pregnant or breastfeeding women. The available literature provides a modest amount of information about improvement in quality of life in association with treatment, patient preferences among the different medications, or patient compliance. Conclusion: Several recent studies provide evidence that modafinil and sodium oxybate are effective for treatment of hypersomnia due to narcolepsy. No studies were identified that report direct comparison of these newer medications with traditional stimulants. Despite significant advances in understanding the pathophysiology of narcolepsy, we do not have an ideal treatment to restore full and sustained alertness. Future investigations should be directed toward development of more effective and better tolerated therapies, and primary prevention.",506,Exclude,2007,Article,Review

Treatment of anxiety disorders in epilepsy: An evidence-based approach,"During recent years growing attention has been paid to psychiatric comorbidities in epilepsy. However, anxiety disorders still remain underrecognized and undertreated. This is largely related to the lack of specific screening instruments and the frequent co-occurrence with mood disorders. Data on treatment are insufficient and clinical practice still relies heavily on individual experience. In this article we review evidence-based treatment strategies for primary major anxiety disorders and adapt them to the specific needs of patients with epilepsy. In panic disorder, a combined approach, namely serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is always indicated during the acute phase. Long-term maintenance treatment may include combined therapy or CBT alone depending on individual cases. For generalized anxiety disorders pregabalin has to be considered first choice for short-term and long-term treatment. In social anxiety disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder SSRIs, in particular sertraline and paroxetine, can be safely used. Obsessive-compulsive disorder represents a serious condition that needs to be approached in a psychiatric setting. CBT should be considered as the first choice in patients with epilepsy. If drug treatment is needed, epileptologists have to be aware that high-dose antidepressants are appropriate and that SSRIs, in particular sertraline, should be considered first choice. In these patients, careful clinical monitoring is indicated, in selected cases, for potential seizure precipitation and side effects due to pharmacodynamics interactions. © Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2013 International League Against Epilepsy.",504,Exclude,2013,Article,Disease
Fluoxetine in posttraumatic stress disorder,"Background: This study was designed to establish the efficacy of the serotonin reuptake blocker fluoxetine in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Method: 64 subjects (22 women and 42 men; 31 veterans and 33 nonveterans) with PTSD entered a 5-week randomized double-blind trial comparing fluoxetine (N = 33) and placebo (N = 31). Results: By Week 5 fluoxetine, but not placebo, significantly reduced overall PTSD symptomatology, as assessed by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) score. Changes were most marked in the arousal and numbing symptom subcategories. Non-VA patients responded much better than VA patients. Fluoxetine was an effective antidepressant independent of its effects on PTSD. Conclusion: Fluoxetine is an effective pharmacotherapeutic agent for treating PTSD and its associated features, particularly in patients without chronic treatment histories.",217,Include,1994,Article,

"Efficacy of sertraline in preventing relapse of posttraumatic stress disorder: Results of a 28-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study","Objective: The study examined the efficacy of sertraline, compared with placebo, in sustaining improvement and preventing relapse over 28 weeks in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) who had completed a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled acute treatment study and a subsequent 24-week open-label study of continuation treatment with sertraline. Method: Ninety-six patients were randomly assigned, in a double-blind design, to 28 weeks of maintenance treatment with sertraline (50-200 mg, N=46; 78% were women) or placebo (N=50; 62% were women). Measures used in biweekly assessments included the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, the Impact of Event Scale, and the Clinical Global Impression severity and improvement ratings. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to estimate time to discontinuation from the study due to relapse, relapse or study discontinuation due to clinical deterioration, and acute exacerbation. Results: Continued treatment with sertraline yielded lower PTSD relapse rates than placebo (5% versus 26%). Patients who received placebo were 6.4 times as likely to experience relapse as were patients who received sertraline. Kaplan-Meier analyses confirmed the protective effect of sertraline in significantly extending time in remission. The ability of sertraline to sustain improvement was comparable across the three core PTSD symptom clusters (reexperiencing/intrusion, avoidance/numbing, and hyperarousal). A regression analysis found early response during acute treatment to be associated with a more than 16-fold reduced risk of relapse after placebo substitution. Sertraline, at a mean endpoint dose of 137 mg, was well tolerated, with no sertraline-related adverse events observed at a rate of 10% or higher. Conclusions: The results provide evidence for the ability of sertraline both to sustain improvement in PTSD symptoms and to provide prophylactic protection against relapse.",195,Include,2001,Article,
Efficacy of sertraline in posttraumatic stress disorder secondary to interpersonal trauma or childhood abuse,"Background. In posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the nature of the trauma and the age of occurrence may have substantial effects on psychobiological sequelae and treatment response. Interpersonal trauma (physical/sexual assault) and childhood abuse are both prevalent and associated with later PTSD. This analysis was conducted to specifically assess the efficacy of sertraline in the treatment of PTSD secondary to interpersonal trauma or childhood abuse.Methods. 395 adult patients with PTSD were randomized to 12-weeks double-blind treatment with flexible dose sertraline (50-200 mg/d) or placebo. Patients with different index traumas were compared in terms of baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as treatment response. Primary efficacy variables included part 2 of the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-2).Results. Interpersonal trauma and childhood abuse were both more common in females than males, and were associated with early age at time of index trauma and longer duration of PTSD, but not with PTSD symptom severity. Sertraline was significantly more effective than placebo on most primary efficacy variables, irrespective of whether patients had experienced interpersonal trauma or childhood abuse.Conclusions. These data demonstrate that sertraline is valuable for the treatment of PTSD, irrespective of whether the precipitating trauma involves interpersonal trauma in general, or childhood abuse in particular.

Efficacy and safety of sertraline treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder: A randomized controlled trial,"Context: Despite the high prevalence, chronicity, and associated comorbidity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the community, few placebo-controlled studies have evaluated the efficacy of pharmacotherapy for this disorder. Objective: To determine if treatment with sertraline hydrochloride effectively diminishes symptoms of PTSD of moderate to marked severity. Design: Twelve-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial preceded by a 2-week, single-blind placebo lead-in period, conducted between May 1996 and June 1997. Setting: Outpatient psychiatric clinics in 8 academic medical centers and 6 clinical research centers. Patients: A total of 187 outpatients with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition diagnosis of PTSD and a Clinician Administered PTSD Scale Part 2 (CAPS-2) minimum total severity score of at least 50 at baseline (mean age, 40 years; mean duration of illness, 12 years; 73% were women; and 61.5% experienced physical or sexual assault). Intervention: Patients were randomized to acute treatment with sertraline hydrochloride in flexible daily dosages of 50 to 200 mg/d, following 1 week at 25 mg/d (n=94); or placebo (n=93). Main Outcome Measures: Baseline-to-end-point changes in CAPS-2 total severity score, Impact of Event Scale total score (IES), and Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGIS), and CGI-Improvement (CGI-I) ratings, compared by treatment vs placebo groups. Results: Sertraline treatment yielded significantly greater improvement than placebo on 3 of the 4 primary outcome measures (mean change from baseline to end point for CAPS-2 total score, - 33.0 vs -23.2 [P=.02], and for CGI-S, -1.2 vs -0.8 [P=.01]; mean CGI-I score at end point, 2.5 vs 3.0 [P=.02]), with the fourth measure, the I ES total score, showing a trend toward significance (mean change from baseline to end point, -16.2 vs -12.1; P=.07). Using a conservative last-observation-carried- forward analysis, treatment with sertraline resulted in a responder rate of 53% at study end point compared with 32% for placebo (P=.008, with responder defined as >30% reduction from baseline in CAPS-2 total severity score and a CGI-I score of 1 [very much improved], or 2 [much improved]). Significant (P<.05) efficacy was evident for sertraline from week 2 on the CAPS-2 total severity score. Sertraline had significant efficacy vs placebo on the CAPS-2 PTSD symptom clusters of avoidance/numbing (P=.02) and increased arousal (P=.03) but not on reexperiencing/intrusion (P=.14). Sertraline was well tolerated, with insomnia the only adverse effect reported significantly more often than placebo (16.0% vs 4.3 %; P=.01).

"Efficacy and safety of paroxetine treatment for chronic PTSD: A fixed-dose, placebo-controlled study","Objective: This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of paroxetine for the treatment of patients with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Method: Outpatients with chronic PTSD according to DSM-IV criteria and a score of 50 or more on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, part 2, were randomly assigned to take placebo (N=186), 20 mg/day of paroxetine (N=183), or 40 mg/day of paroxetine (N=182) for 12 weeks. Efficacy was assessed by examining the change in total score from baseline to endpoint on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, part 2, and rates of response (""very much improved"" or ""much improved"") for global improvement on the Clinical Global Impression scale. Results: Paroxetine-treated patients in both dose groups demonstrated significantly greater improvement on primary outcome measures compared to placebotreated patients in the intent-to-treat analysis. Moreover, paroxetine treatment resulted in statistically significant improvement compared to placebo on all three PTSD symptom clusters (reexperiencing, avoidance/numbing, and hyperarousal), social and occupational impairment, and comorbid depression. Paroxetine was effective for both men and women. Treatment response did not vary by trauma type, time since trauma, or severity of baseline PTSD or depressive symptoms.

Effects of venlafaxine extended release on resilience in posttraumatic stress disorder: An item analysis of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale,"The aim was to evaluate the efficacy of venlafaxine extended release (ER) on characteristics of resilience, measured by the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Data were evaluated from a randomized, 6-month, international, multicenter study of adult outpatients with a primary diagnosis of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition PTSD for ? 6 months, and 17-item Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale score ? 60. Patients were assigned randomly to treatment with flexible-dose venlafaxine ER (37.5-300 mg/day) or placebo. Changes from baseline scores and effect sizes of response to treatment with venlafaxine ER compared with placebo were computed for each item, as well as for the newly developed 2-item and 10-item subscales. Effect sizes across items ranged from 0.41 (moderate) to 0.08 (very weak). The effect size for the Resilience Scale-2 (2-item subscale) was 0.32, which was comparable to the effect sizes of 0.35 for the 25-item full scale and 0.34 for the 10-item subscale. Venlafaxine ER improved resilience on individual Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale items that reflect four factors (hardiness, persistence/tenacity, social support, and faith in a benevolent or meaningful world), to varying degrees in patients with PTSD. The findings suggest that assessment of treatment response might be enhanced by routine evaluation of resilience. © 2008 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",178,Include,2008,Article,
Comparison between paroxetine and behaviour therapy in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD): A pilot study,"Antidepressants and cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) have been reported to decrease severity of psychopathology in PTSD-patients. To date, no study has been carried out which compares psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments. In a randomized pilot study, PTSD-patients were treated either with paroxetine or CBT. Diagnoses were made by structured clinical interviews (ADIS, CAPS). The duration of treatment was 3 months; the paroxetine dosage was 10-50 mg; exposure and cognitive restructuring were the main elements in cognitive-behavioural therapy. Twenty-one patients were included. Drop-outs in both groups occurred within the first 2 weeks. Paroxetine and CBT significantly decreased PTSD-symptoms (CAPS) as well as concurrent depression (MADRS) after 3 months treatment. At 6 month follow-up, symptoms of PTSD had slightly increased in the paroxetine group and further decreased in the cognitive-behavioural therapy group.",114,Include,2004,Article,
COMBINED MIRTAZAPINE and SSRI TREATMENT of PTSD: A PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL,"Background Combined treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) plus mirtazapine has shown superior efficacy in some studies of depression, but has not been studied in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study aimed to assess acceptability of combined sertraline plus mirtazapine treatment for PTSD and to estimate its effect size relative to sertraline plus placebo. Methods Thirty-six adults with PTSD were randomized to 24 weeks of double-blind treatment with sertraline plus mirtazapine or sertraline plus placebo. Outcomes were analyzed with mixed effects models. Results The combined treatment group showed a significantly greater remission rate (P =.042) and improvement in depressive symptoms (P =.023) than the sertraline plus placebo group. There were no significant group differences in the two primary outcomes of treatment retention and PTSD severity, or in other secondary outcomes (sleep impairment, sexual functioning, quality of life, and physical and mental functioning), but the combined treatment group showed numerical advantages on all of these outcomes, and effect sizes relative to sertraline plus placebo ranged from small to moderate (d =.26-.63). Both treatments were well-tolerated, with significantly increased appetite but not weight gain in the combined treatment group. Conclusion Findings suggest that combined treatment of PTSD with sertraline plus mirtazapine may have clinically meaningful advantages in symptomatic improvement, relative to SSRI treatment alone, and acceptable tolerability. Combined treatment with an SSRI plus mirtazapine in PTSD deserves additional study as initial treatment or as an augmentation strategy for nonresponders to an SSRI.",107,Include,2015,Article,
Clinical effect of converting antidepressant therapy from fluoxetine to sertraline,"The effect of replacing fluoxetine with sertraline at two dosage- conversion ratios was studied. Outpatients at a Veterans Affairs mental health clinic who were being treated with fluoxetine were randomly assigned to receive either 50 or 75 mg of sertraline hydrochloride for every 20 mg of fluoxetine (as the hydrochloride salt) or to continue to receive their current dosage of fluoxetine. The subjects were given the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) at baseline and were re-examined at one-month intervals for three months with the HDRS and BDI and the Clinical Global Impression of Change. Each patient was re- evaluated by the same blinded investigator. A total of 45 patients (42 men and 3 women) completed the study. The final overall response did not differ significantly among the three groups. There were also no significant differences among the groups in the proportions of patients with HDRS and BDI scores classified as proving, worsening, or not changing. Improvement was more common in patients receiving the higher dosage of sertraline. Few adverse effects were reported. Outpatients receiving fluoxetine were switched to sertraline therapy without a loss of control of depression and without substantial adverse effects.",96,Include,1995,Article,
Characterizing the effects of sertraline in post-traumatic stress disorder,"Background. Sertraline has a proved efficacy in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but it is unknown which symptoms respond or in what sequence this occurs. Such information might be useful clinically and heuristically. Method. The study examined the effects of sertraline on the individual symptoms of PTSD. It also examined whether early changes in anger explained drug-induced change in other symptoms over time. Mixed models analysis was applied to datasets from two 12-week placebo-controlled trials of sertraline. A validated self-rating scale (DTS) was used to assess treatment efficacy. Results. Sertraline was superior to placebo on 15 of 17 symptoms, especially in the numbing and hyperarousal clusters. A strong effect was found on anger from week 1, which partly explained the subsequent effects of sertraline on other symptoms, some of which began to show significantly greater response to drug than to placebo at week 6 (emotional upset at reminders, anhedonia, detachment, numbness, hypervigilance) and week 10 (avoidance of activities, foreshortened future). Conclusions. Sertraline exercises a broad spectrum effect in PTSD. Effects are more apparent on the psychological rather than somatic symptoms of PTSD, with an early modulation of anger and, perhaps, other affects, preceding improvement in other symptoms.",90,Include,2002,Article,
Treatment of traumatized refugees with Sertraline versus Venlafaxine in combination with psychotherapy - study protocol for a randomized clinical trial,"Background: Sufficient evidence is lacking to draw final conclusions on the efficiency of medical and psychological treatments of traumatized refugees with PTSD. The pharmacological treatments of choice today for post-traumatic stress disorder are antidepressants from the subgroup selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, especially Sertraline. The evidence for the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the treatment of complex post-traumatic stress disorder in traumatized refugees is very limited. Venlafaxine is a dual-action antidepressant that works on several pathways in the brain. It influences areas in the brain which are responsible for the enhanced anxiety and hyper-arousal experienced by traumatized refugees and which some studies have found to be enlarged among patients suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.Design: This study will include approximately 150 patients, randomized into two different groups treated with either Sertraline or Venlafaxine. Patients in both groups will receive the same manual-based cognitive behavioral therapy, which has been especially adapted to this group of patients. The treatment period will be 6 to 7 months. The trial endpoints will be post-traumatic stress disorder and depressive symptoms and social functioning, all measured on validated ratings scales. Furthermore the study will examine the relation between a psycho-social resources and treatment outcome based on 15 different possible outcome predictors.Discussion: This study is expected to bring forward new knowledge on treatment and clinical evaluation of traumatized refugees and the results are expected to be used in reference programs and clinical guidelines.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01569685. © 2013 Sonne et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",512,Exclude,2013,Article,Study design
Treatment of trauma-affected refugees with venlafaxine versus sertraline combined with psychotherapy - a randomised study,"Background: The prevalence of trauma-related psychiatric disorders is high among refugees. Despite this, little is known about the effect of pharmacological treatment for this patient group. The objective of the present study was therefore to examine differences in the effects of venlafaxine and sertraline on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression and functional impairment in trauma-affected refugees. Methods: The study was a randomised pragmatic trial comparing venlafaxine and sertraline in combination with psychotherapy and social counselling. PTSD symptoms were measured on the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire - part IV, which was the primary outcome measure. Other outcome measures included: Hopkins Symptom Check List-25 (depression and anxiety), Social Adjustment Scale - short version (social functioning), WHO-5 Well-being Index (quality of life), Crisis Support Scale (support from social network), Sheehan Disability Scale (disability in three areas of functioning), Hamilton Depression and Anxiety scale, the somatisation items of the Symptoms Checklist-90, Global Assessment of Functioning scales and the summarised score of pain in four body areas rated on visual analogue scales. Results: Two hundred seven adult refugee patients were included in the trial (98 in the venlafaxine and 109 in the sertraline group). Of these, 195 patients were eligible for intention-to-treat analyses. Small but significant pre-treatment to post-treatment differences were found on the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire and a number of other ratings in both groups. On the primary outcome measure, no difference was found in treatment effect between the sertraline and venlafaxine group. A significant group difference was found in favour of sertraline on the Sheehan Disability Scale. Conclusion: Sertraline had a slightly better outcome than venlafaxine on some of the secondary outcome measures, but not on the primary outcome measure. Furthermore, a higher percentage of dropouts was found in the venlafaxine group compared to the sertraline group. Although this could indicate that sertraline was better tolerated, which is supported by other studies, a final conclusion on tolerability cannot be drawn from the current study due to lack of systematic reporting of side effects.

Neural correlates of emotional reactivity and regulation associated with treatment response in a randomized clinical trial for posttraumatic stress disorder,"Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating condition often associated with difficulty in emotion regulation, including reappraising negative emotions. This study assessed neural mechanisms associated with emotion regulation in veterans prior to and following treatment for PTSD. Participants with PTSD and combat exposed controls (CC) completed diagnostic evaluation and underwent fMRI scanning while completing Emotion Regulation Task (ERT) and Emotional Faces Assessment Task (EFAT). Participants with PTSD were randomly assigned to Prolonged Exposure plus placebo (PE+PLB), Sertraline plus enhanced medication management (SERT+EMM), or PE plus SERT (PE+SERT) and repeated diagnostic evaluation and MRI scanning following treatment. The amygdala, dmPFC, and dlPFC were examined as regions of interest. On ERT, veterans with PTSD showed significantly less dmPFC activation than CCs during reappraisal vs emotional maintenance. Within the PTSD group, results demonstrated a significant association between less activation in the dmPFC during emotion reappraisal vs maintenance trials before treatment and greater reductions in symptoms from pre- to post-treatment. During the EFAT, there were no group differences between participants with PTSD and CCs in brain activation, and no relationships between brain function and PTSD symptoms. These findings suggest that less emotional reactivity might potentially reflect less need for recruitment of prefrontal regions when reappraising negative emotion, and is an individual factor associated with better treatment outcome.",282,Exclude,2020,Article,Intervention
Using actigraphy to measure the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on night-to-night variability in awakenings,"Introduction: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been associated with various sleep disturbances, including increased awakenings. However, studies have typically employed polysomnography to examine this relationship. Actigraphy affords the benefit of collecting information over a longer duration, allowing for the observation of nightly variation in sleep parameters. Methods: Twenty-four subjects with posttraumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder (63% male; M = 51.95, SD = 10.20) wore actigraphs over a period of one week. Approximately one-third of these patients were prescribed SSRIs, including citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline. These cross-sectional data were analyzed using ANOVA techniques. Results: There were significant differences between individuals who were and were not taking SSRIs. Individuals prescribed SSRIs were more likely to have an increase in the night-to-night variability in the frequency of awakenings F(1,21) = 7.117 (P = 0.02), and a tendency towards more nightly variability in the percentage of time spent awake in bed F(1,21) = 4.159 (P = 0.06). As expected, individuals who received SSRIs had more frequent awakenings F(1,23) = 7.553 (P = 0.01), more wake time after sleep onset F(1,23) = 4.634 (P = 0.04), and a trend towards a higher percentage of time spent awake in bed F(1,23) = 3.299 (P = 0.08). Conclusion: Interestingly, SSRIs were associated with an increase in both the nightly variability of awakenings and percentage of time spent awake. Patients on SSRIs also experienced a greater number of awakenings, and spent (on average) more time awake than those not on SSRIs. These results extend and confirm polysomnography findings showing that SSRI use contributes to fragmented sleep. From a behavioral perspective, SSRIs may additionally hinder patients' abilities to establish a routine sleep/wake pattern.",519,Exclude,2010,Conference Abstract,Study design
The new guidelines from the British Association for Psychopharmacology for anxiety disorders,"Anxiety disorders, which often commence in childhood, are among the most common psychological disorders encountered in primary care practice, with 1 year and lifetime prevalence (excluding post-traumatic stress disorder) of 12.0 and 21.1%, respectively. Because of their wide range of clinical presentation and comorbidity with other disorders such as depression, they are frequently under-recognized. These factors, coupled with lack of physician confidence in their ability to treat these conditions, leads to under-treatment. Treatment of anxiety disorders is further complicated by a significant lag time between first onset and initial contact with a treatment provider. Even for those anxiety disorders characterized by relatively early treatment contact (i.e. panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder) B/50% of patients are treated at first onset of symptoms. Following treatment, approximately 50% of patients significantly improve over 6-16 months, but complete recovery is uncommon. To help remedy this situation, the British Association for Pharmacology (BAP) has issued comprehensive evidence-based guidelines (developed from a consensus meeting 20-21 May 2004 involving clinical experts and representatives of user groups) to aid clinicians in diagnosing and treating anxiety disorders. The guidelines focus on pharmacological interventions for all primary anxiety disorders in adults (18-65 years), and are intended for doctors in primary care, as well as specialist practice. Importantly, the guidelines cover the difficult topic of treatment non-response. The BAP guidelines link treatment recommendations with quality of evidence, allowing clinicians to judge the confidence they might place in particular recommendations. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.",474,Exclude,2006,Conference Paper,Review
The neurobiological correlates of childhood adversity and implications for treatment,"Objective: This article provides an overview of research on the neurobiological correlates of childhood adversity and a selective review of treatment implications. Method: Findings from a broad array of human and animal studies of early adversity were reviewed. Results: Topics reviewed include neuroendocrine, neurotrophic, neuroimaging, and cognitive effects of adversity, as well as genetic and epigenetic influences. Effects of early-life stress on treatment outcome are considered, and development of treatments designed to address the neurobiological abnormalities is discussed. Conclusion: Early adversity is associated with abnormalities of several neurobiological systems that are implicated in the development of psychopathology and other medical conditions. Early-life stress negatively impacts treatment outcome, and individuals may require treatments that are specific to this condition. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.",473,Exclude,2013,Article,Study design
