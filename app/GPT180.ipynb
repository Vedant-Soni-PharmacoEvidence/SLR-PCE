    "    You are an expert systematic literature reviewer. This is the Full Text Screening phase. You have to analyze the entire document provided to you. Based on the below exclusion and inclusion criteria, please classify the given citation as 'Included' or 'Excluded'. Apply the Exclusion Criteria first. If any statement in the Exclusion Criteria is true, mark the citation as 'Excluded'. If the citation passes the Exclusion Criteria, then check the Inclusion Criteria. Mark the citation as 'Included' only if it strictly and exactly passes all Inclusion Criteria statements; otherwise, mark the citation as 'Excluded'. \n",

    "    3. Medications: Include studies that primarily investigate the utilization of the following medications: sertraline, 'sertraline plus brexpiprazole', fluoxetine, paroxetine, and venlafaxine. These medications are permissible for use either as standalone treatments (monotherapy) or in combination therapy. However, in cases of combination therapy, it is imperative that the combination exclusively involves the aforementioned medications.\n",

Study Type: Literature reviews, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, review, narrative review, observational studies (including retrospective, case-control, cohort studies, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamics study, cost-effectiveness, economic evaluation studies, longitudinal studies, and cross-sectional studies).\n",
    "    2. Population: Studies exclusively involving animals, adolescents, children, or populations other than those with post-traumatic stress disorder.\n",
    "    3. Medications: Exclude studies that do not primarily investigate the utilization of the following medications: sertraline, 'sertraline plus brexpiprazole', fluoxetine, paroxetine, and venlafaxine. These medications are permissible for use either as standalone treatments (monotherapy) or in combination therapy. However, in cases of combination therapy, it is imperative that the combination exclusively involves the aforementioned medications.\n",
    "    4. Strictly mark the citation as excluded if it mentions review or pooled analysis which includes data from more than one study.\n",
