Venlafaxine extended release in posttraumatic stress disorder: A sertraline- and placebo-controlled study,"This 12-week, double-blind, multicenter trial evaluated the efficacy of venlafaxine extended release (ER), sertraline, and placebo in adult outpatients (N = 538) with a primary diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, symptoms for 6 months or more and 17-item Clinician-administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-SX17) score of 60 or more. Patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or flexible doses of venlafaxine ER (37.5-300 mg/d) or sertraline (25-200 mg/d) for 12 weeks or less. The primary outcome was the baseline-to-end point change in total CAPS-SX17 score (last observation carried forward). Secondary measures included CAPS-SX17 symptom cluster scores for reexperiencing/intrusion, avoidance/numbing, and hyperarousal; frequency of remission (CAPS-SX17 ≤20); and changes in Davidson Trauma Scale total score and symptom cluster scores for avoidance/numbing, hyperarousal, and reexperiencing/intrusion. Mean changes in CAPS-SX17 scores were -41.8, -39.4, and -33.9 for venlafaxine ER (P < 0.05 vs. placebo), sertraline, and placebo, respectively. Mean changes for venlafaxine ER, sertraline, and placebo in CAPS-SX17 cluster scores were -13.0, -11.7, and -11.0 for reexperiencing; -17.1, -16.8, and -13.7 (P < 0.05 both active treatments vs. placebo) for avoidance/numbing; and -11.8, -10.9, and -9.2 (P < 0.05 venlafaxine vs. placebo) for hyperarousal. Week 12 remission rates were venlafaxine ER 30.2% (P < 0.05 vs. placebo), sertraline 24.3%, and placebo 19.6%. The venlafaxine ER group had significantly better Davidson Trauma Scale total and cluster scores than placebo. Mean maximum daily doses were 225-mg venlafaxine ER and 151-mg sertraline. Both treatments were generally well tolerated. Study results suggest that venlafaxine ER is effective and well tolerated in the short-term treatment of PTSD.

Treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder with venlafaxine extended release: A 6-month randomized controlled trial,"Context: No large-scale posttraumatic stress disorder drug trials have been conducted to evaluate treatment effects beyond 12 weeks outside of those with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of venlafaxine extended release (ER), a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, in posttraumatic stress disorder. Design: 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Setting: International study at 56 sites. Patients: Adult outpatients (N = 329) with a primary diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder as defined in the DSM-IV, symptoms for 6 months or longer, and a 17-item Clinician-Administered Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Scale score of 60 or higher. Intervention: Patients randomly assigned to receive flexible doses of venlafaxine ER (37.5-300 mg/d) or placebo for 24 weeks. Main Outcome Measures: Primary measure was the change from baseline in the Clinician-Administered Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Scale score. Secondary measures included remission, defined as a Clinician-Administered Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Scale score of 20 or lower, and changes in symptom cluster scores, frequency of remission, and time to remission. Measures of stress vulnerability, resilience, depression, quality of life, functioning, and global illness severity were also taken. Results: Mean changes from baseline in Clinician-Administered Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Scale total scores at end point were -51.7 for venlafaxine ER and -43.9 for placebo (P = .006). Improvement was significantly greater for the venlafaxine ER group than for the placebo group in cluster scores for reexperiencing (P = .008) and avoidance/numbing (P = .006), but not for hyperarousal. Remission rates were 50.9% for venlafaxine ER and 37.5% for placebo (P = .01). The venlafaxine ER group also showed significantly greater improvement at end point than the placebo group (P = .05) on all other reported outcome measures. The mean maximum daily dose of venlafaxine ER was 221.5 mg/d. Withdrawal rates were similar between groups with no significant difference in dropouts attributable to adverse events. Conclusion: In this study, venlafaxine ER was effective and well tolerated in short-term and continuation treatment of patients with posttraumatic stress disorder. ©2006 American Medical Association.

Tolerability of fluoxetine in posttraumatic stress disorder,"Purpose: In response to earlier reports that raised concerns about the tolerability of fluoxetine in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), this study was conducted to systematically delineate treatment-emergent symptoms (TES) associated with fluoxetine treatment of PTSD. Methods: Sixty-five patients with PTSD enrolled in one of two identical-protocol, 12-week studies and received double-blind fluoxetine or placebo. TES data were obtained using a patient-rated checklist, Severity of Symptoms Scale (SOSS). Results: Only a single patient discontinued treatment due to medication side effects. Compared to placebo, only three statistically significant TES (nausea, diarrhea, and thirst) occurred more frequently in fluoxetine subjects. Fluoxetine was not associated with any statistically significant activating effects. There were no statistically significant associations between the total number of TES experienced and treatment, gender, or comorbid depressive or panic disorders. Conclusions: This systematic assessment of TES indicated that PTSD patients tolerated fluoxetine well without pronounced activating side effects. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Symptom-specific effects of fluoxetine in post-traumatic stress disorder,"The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have become a first line treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In a recent double-blind study in civilians, fluoxetine produced clinically and statistically significant effects on all general measures of PTSD. We examined the specific effects of fluoxetine versus placebo in the above mentioned study of PTSD clusters and individual symptoms. Individuals were included if they met criteria for PTSD according to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID). Symptoms were assessed at sequential time points by the Structured Interview for PTSD (STP), a clinician interview based assessment, and a self-report scale, the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS). A total of 53 patients were included in the analysis. On the SIP and DTS, fluoxetine was found to produce statistically significant changes on all clusters. Significant effects for fluoxetine were noted on 10 items of the DTS, and 8 items of the SIP. The SIP and DTS had 6 items in common that were significant. Fluoxetine exerts a broad spectrum effect in reducing all the symptom clusters of PTSD in this sample. The symptoms of being physically upset at reminders of the trauma, avoiding thoughts of the trauma, having difficulty enjoying things, feeling distant/estranged, having a sense of foreshortened future, and impaired concentration, were the symptoms most responsive to the effects of treatment with fluoxetine on both scales.

Sertraline in the treatment of co-occurring alcohol dependence and posttraumatic stress disorder,"Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequently co-occurs with alcohol use disorders. This study investigated the use of sertraline, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, in treating co-occurring symptoms of alcohol dependence and PTSD. Methods: A total of 94 individuals with current alcohol dependence and PTSD were randomly assigned to receive sertraline (150 mg/day) or placebo for 12 weeks. Post hoc cluster analysis of baseline characteristics was used to define subgroups of participants. Results: There was a significant decrease in alcohol use during the trial in both the sertraline and the placebo groups. Cluster analysis revealed significant medication group by cluster interactions for alcohol-related outcomes. Sertraline-treated participants with less severe alcohol dependence and early-onset PTSD had significantly fewer drinks per drinking day (p < 0.001). For participants with more severe alcohol dependence and later onset PTSD, the placebo group had significantly greater decreases in drinks per drinking day (p < 0.01) and average number of drinks consumed per day (p < 0.05). Conclusions: There may be subtypes of alcohol-dependent individuals who respond differently to serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment. Further investigation of differential responders may lead to improvements in the pharmacological treatment of co-occurring alcohol dependence and PTSD.

"Remission in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Effects of sertraline as assessed by the Davidson Trauma Scale, Clinical Global Impressions and the Clinician-Administered PTSD scale","Rates of remission were examined in two controlled 12-week studies of sertraline and placebo for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The performance of three scales was evaluated: the self-rated Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS), and two interviewer scales: the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and Clinical Global Impressions (CGI). Sertraline proved significantly superior to placebo with respect to remission on all three ratings. Rates of remission were very similar for all scales, ranging from 23.1-26.3% for sertraline and 13.9-14.9% for placebo. Traditional thresholds for the CAPS and DTS were tested relative to the CGI and to each other. The CAPS and DTS thresholds of < 20 and < 18 were found to be valid. © 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",394,Include,2004,Article,
"Ziprasidone Augmentation of SSRI Antidepressants in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Pilot Study of Augmentation Therapy","Background Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is often a chronic, disabling illness for which antidepressant medications (ie, SSRI) are considered the primary psychopharmacological treatment. However, many patients remain refractory to antidepressants alone or in combination with psychotherapy. Safe and effective treatments for individuals with refractory PTSD are needed. This study aimed to examine ziprasidone augmentation of SSRI treatment of PTSD. Methods This was a 2-phase study. In phase 1, subjects were treated with paroxetine or sertraline for 8 weeks. Individuals refractory to the SSRI treatment then entered into phase II of the study and were randomized, in a double-blind fashion, to 8 weeks of treatment with either ziprasidone or placebo. The primary outcome measure was change in Clinician Administered PTSD Scale total scores with the intent-to-treat sample. Secondary outcome measures included Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores, measures of depression and anxiety, and safety measures. Results No significant differences were observed on the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, or other outcome measures between ziprasidone and placebo groups. No significant differences were observed for safety measures including metabolic profiles, extrapyramidal symptoms/movement disorder rating scales, nor study dropout. Conclusions Although no significant differences were noted in efficacy or safety measures between ziprasidone and placebo in this pilot study, the small sample size prevents definitive conclusions.",546,Exclude,2019,Article,Intervention
"World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) guidelines for treatment of anxiety, obsessive-compulsive and posttraumatic stress disorders–Version 3. Part II: OCD and PTSD","Aim: This is the third version of the guideline of the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) Task Force for the Pharmacological Treatment of Anxiety, Obsessive–Compulsive and Posttraumatic Stress Disorders which was published in 2002 and revised in 2008. Method: A consensus panel of 34 international experts representing 22 countries developed recommendations based on efficacy and acceptability of the treatments. In this version, not only medications but also psychotherapies and other non-pharmacological interventions were evaluated, applying the same rigorous methods that are standard for the assessment of medication treatments. Result: The present paper (Part II) contains recommendations based on published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for the treatment of OCD (n = 291) and PTSD (n = 234) in children, adolescents, and adults. The accompanying paper (Part I) contains the recommendations for the treatment of anxiety disorders. For OCD, first-line treatments are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Internet-CBT was also superior to active controls. Several second-line medications are available, including clomipramine. For treatment-resistant cases, several options are available, including augmentation of SSRI treatment with antipsychotics and other drugs. Other non-pharmacological treatments, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), deep brain stimulation (DBS) and others were also evaluated. For PTSD, SSRIs and the SNRI venlafaxine are first-line treatments. CBT is the psychotherapy modality with the best body of evidence. For treatment-unresponsive patients, augmentation of SSRI treatment with antipsychotics may be an option. Conclusion: OCD and PTSD can be effectively treated with CBT and medications.",545,Exclude,2023,Article,Review

"World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of anxiety, obsessive-compulsive and post-traumatic stress disorders - First revision","In this report, which is an update of a guideline published in 2002 (Bandelow et al. 2002, World J Biol Psychiatry 3:171), recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are presented. Since the publication of the first version of this guideline, a substantial number of new randomized controlled studies of anxiolytics have been published. In particular, more relapse prevention studies are now available that show sustained efficacy of anxiolytic drugs. The recommendations, developed by the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) Task Force for the Pharmacological Treatment of Anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive and Post-traumatic Stress Disorders, a consensus panel of 30 international experts, are now based on 510 published randomized, placebo- or comparator-controlled clinical studies (RCTs) and 130 open studies and case reports. First-line treatments for these disorders are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and the calcium channel modulator pregabalin. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are equally effective for some disorders, but many are less well tolerated than the SSRIs/SNRIs. In treatment-resistant cases, benzodiazepines may be used when the patient does not have a history of substance abuse disorders. Potential treatment options for patients unresponsive to standard treatments are described in this overview. Although these guidelines focus on medications, non-pharmacological were also considered. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and other variants of behaviour therapy have been sufficiently investigated in controlled studies in patients with anxiety disorders, OCD, and PTSD to support them being recommended either alone or in combination with the above medicines.",543,Exclude,2008,Article,Review
Withdrawal symptoms of benzodiazepines in panic disorder patients' pharmacotherapy,"[Purpose] This study compared the withdrawal symptoms of long-acting benzodiazepine (ethyl loflazepate; loflazepate) with those of short-acting benzodiazepine (alprazolam) in combined pharmacotherapy with fluvoxamine (FLV) to treat panic disorder patients. [Methods] The subjects were thirty-two patients meeting the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for panic disorder. All subjects were outpatients at the Department of Neuropsychiatry, Osaka City University Medical School Hospital. All subjects gave informed consent to participate in this study. The subjects were allocated into two groups; FLV and loflazepate group (n=16) or FLV and alprazolam group (n=16). Based on clinical status, FLV was gradually increased to 150 mg/day and then remained constant for 20 weeks of the trial. The dosages for benzodiazepines (BZs) were increased from 1 to 2 mg/day for loflazepate, and from 0.8 to 1.6 mg/day for alprazolam. After 12 weeks, the respective BZ was gradually reduced by 0.5 mg/day (loflazepate) or 0.4 mg/day (alprazolam) every 2 weeks, then discontinued. To evaluate symptoms of panic disorder, efficacy and side effects, Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A), Sheehan Disability Scale were used. To evaluate safety and withdrawal symptoms during the tapering of benzodiazepines, the Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Symptom Questionnaire (BWSQ) was used. [Results] Either combination therapy using FLV with loflazepate or alprazolam was effective in the treatment of patients with panic disorder. However, patients treated with FLV and long-acting loflazepate had significantly fewer withdrawal symptoms than patients treated with FLV and short-acting alprazolam. [Conclusions] In combined pharmacotherapy for patients with panic disorder, longer-acting loflazepate combined with FLV had the same effects on the symptoms of panic disorder and fewer withdrawal symptoms than shorter-acting alprazolam during tapering and after discontinuation of BZs. These findings suggested that longer-acting BZs are better suited to the treatment of patients with panic disorder with combined pharmacotherapy using FLV and BZs.",541,Exclude,2009,Article,Disease
"Why psychiatric drugs ""work"": The attribution of positive effects due to psychological factors","While outcome research has attempted to elucidate the real benefit of any treatment through randomized, double-blind studies, the role of placebo and other psychological reactions has been given scant but growing attention. This article examines the nature and power of the placebo in the context of antidepressant therapy. Other factors influencing patient reports of positive response are considered, including emotional blunting, victimization, and rebound. It is concluded that the attribution of healing properties to antidepressant drugs is complex and multifaceted, and that the modest advantage of these drugs over placebo may well derive from psychological, not physiological, factors. © 2008 Springer Publishing Company.",540,Exclude,2008,Article,Review
Where are we going with SSRIs?,"During the past decade the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRls) have become established as the treatment of choice for depression. As newer antidepressants become available on the market, it is important to reappraise the position of the SSRIs in the management of depression. This review will address the question: where are we going with the SSRIs? The continued establishment of the SSRIs as first-line treatment for depression will be discussed, focusing on the more rapid onset of antidepressant efficacy seen with pindolol augmentation and the use of SSRIs for treatment of depression in patients with physical illnesses, particularly ischaemic heart disease. The SSRIs have well-documented efficacy in panic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and paroxetine has recently been licensed for social anxiety disorder/social phobia in some countries. Results will be presented from studies with the SSRIs in new therapeutic areas, including post-traumatic stress disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.

When do you prescribe antidepressants to depressed children? Topical collection on mood disorders,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) in children and adolescents is a public health problem that requires evidence-based management. Our objective is to review available studies, with a PubMed search, and briefly summarize safety and efficacy results of (mostly SSRI) antidepressants in children and adolescents with MDD. Fluoxetine and escitalopram are safe and effective in the treatment of MDD in children and adolescents both in reduction of symptoms, and in remission/response rates. However, response rates are lower than for non-OCD anxiety. Sertraline also had positive results in one study that pooled results from two studies. The number needed to treat (NNT) for MDD is 10, and the number needed to harm (NNH) for suicidality is 112. Methodological limitations in the studies include, mainly, high placebo response rates, associated with multiple study sites, younger patients, and lower MDD severity. Treatment should be maintained close to 1 year after remission, to prevent relapse. FDA-approved fluoxetine and escitalopram are safe and effective in the treatment of pediatric MDD. Sertraline also has some data supporting its efficacy and safety, but is not FDA-approved. The possible modest increase in suicidal ideation in some patients should be known by clinicians, but the risk/benefit ratio is 1 to 11.2 times favorable to using SSRIs in moderate to severe MDD. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",538,Exclude,2013,Article,Review
WCA Recommendations for the Long-Term Treatment of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common and disabling condition. In addition to combat-related PTSD, the disorder occurs in civilians exposed to severe traumatic events, with the community prevalence rate for the combined populations reaching as high as 12%. If left untreated, PTSD may continue for years after the stressor event, resulting in severe functional and emotional impairment and a dramatic reduction in quality of life, with negative economic consequences for both the sufferer and society as a whole. Although PTSD is often overlooked, diagnosis is relatively straight-forward once a triggering stressor event and the triad of persistent symptoms-reexperiencing the traumatic event, avoiding stimuli associated with the trauma, and hyperarousal-have been identified. However, comorbid conditions of anxiety and depression frequently hamper accurate diagnosis. Treatment for PTSD includes psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. The latter includes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Only SSRIs have been proven effective and safe in long-term randomized controlled trials. Current guidelines from the Expert Consensus Panel for PTSD recommend treatment of chronic PTSD for a minimum of 12-24 months.",537,Exclude,2003,Conference Paper,Review
War trauma and PTSD in Ukraine's civilian population: comparing urban-dwelling to internally displaced persons,"INTRODUCTION: War in Ukraine started in March 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea and continues today in the Donbass region of Eastern Ukraine. Over 1.5 million people in these regions have been displaced from their homes. We conducted this study 36 months after the conflict began and interviewed civilians residing in Ukraine. PURPOSE: This study examines the prevalence of exposure to war trauma, rates of PTSD by symptom clusters, and whether socio-demographic factors are associated with positive scores for PTSD among civilian urban-dwelling and internally displaced persons in Ukraine during the ongoing conflict in its Donbass region. METHODS: Face-to-face interviews were conducted using a multi-stage random sample of the general population in two large cities (Kharkiv and Lviv) in Ukraine (n = 1247) and a purposive sample of internally displaced persons (n = 300), half living in each city. Exposure to trauma, symptom clusters for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and overall PTSD were assessed. RESULTS: We found widespread direct exposure to conflict-related traumatic events (65%) among internally displaced people (IDPs) compared to a sizable minority (23%) of urban-dwelling people (UDPs). We found elevated prevalence of PTSD symptoms that were also uniformly spread within several socio-demographic factors. There were, however, significant differences in PTSD between (1) IDPs compared to UDPs and (2) those UDPs with Ukrainian compared to Russian ethnic identity, the former of each pair showing increased likelihoods of positive PTSD scores. CONCLUSIONS: Ukraine's adult civilians, enduring the prolonged engagement in war with Russia and Russian separatists, have elevated rates of PTSD. Moreover, those who have been displaced by the ongoing conflict (IDPs) have significantly higher levels of PTSD compared to UDPs.",536,Exclude,2022,Article,Study design
Vintage treatments for PTSD: A reconsideration of tricyclic drugs,"Serotonin (SSRI) and serotonin-norepinephrine (SNRI) reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are the first-line recommended drug treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); but despite their benefits, much residual pathology remains and no new drugs have yet emerged with a clearly demonstrated benefit for treating the disorder. A case is made that tricyclic drugs deserve a closer look, based on their ability to affect several of the main neurotransmitters that are relevant to PTSD. Their promising efficacy, which was shown 30 years ago, had not been followed up, until a recent trial of desipramine found advantages over a SSRI in PTSD with comorbid alcohol dependence. Opportunities exist for studying newer and purportedly safer tricyclic formulations, as well as further the work with older, established compounds. A reappraisal of their risk:benefit ratio seems in order, when treating PTSD.",533,Exclude,2015,Article,Review
"Venlafaxine XR for major depressive disorder after spinal cord injury: Rationale, results, and recommendations","Objective: To examine the efficacy and tolerability of venlafaxine XR (VFNXR) for major depressive disorder (MDD) in people with SCI. Design: Multisite, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Subjects were block randomized and stratified by site, prior history of MDD, and lifetime history of substance dependence. Participants/Methods: Participants were recruited from outpatient clinics at 6 SCI treatment centers. Subjects were 18-64, at least 1 month SCI, with DSM-IV MDD or dysthymic disorder and no suicidal intent or plan. The primary outcome was the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) at 12 weeks. Results: A total of 2,536 people were screened, 133 were randomized, and 126 (95%) were retained. Participants were on average 40 years old, 47% had cervical injuries, and 53% had AIS A SCI. Common comorbidities were chronic pain (94%), substance dependence (47%), and PTSD (48%). Mixed model regression revealed no significant differences between the VFNXR and placebo groups on improvement in depression severity (HAM-D) from baseline to 12 weeks. There was a nonsignificant trend for a larger proportion of people with a history of substance dependence to achieve remission on VFNXR (50%) compared to placebo (25%; P = .06), an effect that was statistically significant among completers (P = .048). Conclusions: Future research should examine the efficacy of alternative treatments (eg, behavior activation, cognitive therapy, physical activity), combined treatment, or intensified treatment approaches. VFNXR may be an effective antidepressant for certain SCI subgroups.",532,Exclude,2013,Conference Abstract,Disease

Venlafaxine extended release (XR) for the prophylaxis of migraine and tension-type headache: A retrospective study in a clinical setting,"Objective. - To assess the efficacy of extended-release venlafaxine in the prophylaxis of migraine and chronic tension-type headache. Background. - Venlafaxine, a structurally novel antidepressant, is a selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. This study is the first to test the effects of extended-release venlafaxine on headaches. Methods. - Patients were evaluated on a retrospective basis. Fifty-six patients with chronic tension-type headache and 114 patients with migraine were prescribed extended-release venlafaxine. Nearly all the study subjects had been resistant to several previous preventive medications. Patients took venlafaxine for an average of 6 months with a median dose of 150 mg (range, 37.5 to 300 mg). Results. - The mean frequency of headaches in the group with chronic tension-type headache fell from 24.0 to 15.2 per month (P<.0001). The group with migraine showed a reduction from 16.1 to 11.1 headaches per month (P<.0001). The medicine was well tolerated. Conclusions. - This trial indicates that extended-release venlafaxine has potential in headache prophylaxis based on its efficacy and safety profile. We recommend a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to further assess the role of extended-release venlafaxine in headache prevention.",526,Exclude,2000,Article,Study design
VE-MMODE – A randomized controlled trial of Venlafaxine versus Escitalopram for treatment of mild to moderate depression in persons with epilepsy,"Objectives: Depression in persons with epilepsy (PWE) goes undiagnosed and untreated. Despite being common, there are no direct efficacy comparisons of available antidepressants in PWE. Our aim was to compare the effectiveness of Venlafaxine (VEN) and Escitalopram (ESCIT) in comorbid depression in PWE. Methods: In a single-center, prospective, double-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) 90 PWE (age ≥18 years) with mild to moderate depression, were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive ESCIT (5–20 mg/day) or VEN (37.5–150 mg/day) for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was to study differences in the efficacy, based on the change in scores of the Hamilton depression rating scale (HAM-D) at 8 weeks. Seizure frequency, QOLIE-31, adverse event profile, and medication adherence were secondary outcome measures. Results: Using the NDDI-E scale, we screened 350 PWE, 90 were enrolled. ITT analysis included all participants and the PP analysis included 40 participants to VEN group and 42 to ESCIT group. Baseline mean (±SD) HAM-D scores for both groups were similar (13.53 ± 3.27; 13.02 ± 3.57). The mean difference (95%CI) on HAM-D scores at 8 weeks was found to be significant within both groups (ITT/PP- VEN: 7.75(6.75, 8.79)/7.92 (7.06, 8.78); p < 0.001, ESCIT: 8.21 (7.39, 9.03)/8.23(7.43, 9.04); p < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in the efficacy of VEN versus ESCIT at 8 weeks. A significant improvement in QOLIE-31 index and seizure frequency was observed from baseline in both the groups. 90% of those on VEN and 92.9% of those using ESCIT adhered to the treatment at week 8. Adverse events were more in VEN group than the ESCIT group. Conclusions: This study found that HAMD scores improved significantly in the ESCIT and VEN groups, despite the fact that there was no clinically meaningful difference observed between the two groups. Trials with a larger sample size and longer duration are required to establish whether ESCIT or VEN is superior.",525,Exclude,2023,Article,Disease
Within-patient association between emotion regulation and outcome in prolonged exposure for posttraumatic stress disorder,"OBJECTIVE: Difficulties with emotion regulation (ER) are a risk factor for the development and maintenance of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Less is known about temporal relations between ER and PTSD symptom change during treatment, including whether ER may represent a more potent change ingredient for some patients relative to others. This study examined the association between within-patient changes in ER and next-session PTSD symptom change and whether this association was more pronounced for patients with poorer baseline ER, more severe depression, or higher borderline personality disorder symptoms. METHOD: Data derived from a randomized controlled trial (NCT01600456) in which 149 adults with PTSD received up to 10 sessions of prolonged exposure (PE) or PE + sertraline. Patients rated difficulties with ER and PTSD symptoms repeatedly during treatment. Moderators were assessed at baseline. RESULTS: Cross-lagged, dynamic structural equation models revealed that ER improvements were associated with next-session reductions in PTSD (standardized effect = 0.13). PTSD symptom reduction was also associated with next-session ER improvement (standardized effect = 0.34). Moderator analyses revealed that the within-person ER-PTSD symptoms association was stronger for patients with higher baseline depression (standardized effect = 0.39). CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in PTSD symptoms may facilitate ER improvements during PE and PE augmented with sertraline rather than improvements in ER producing changes in PTSD symptoms. For patients with higher severity co-occurring depression, ER may represent a more active change ingredient. PE therapists could therefore consider placing particular emphasis on improving ER capabilities when working with this subgroup of patients.

Treatment of traumatized refugees with Sertraline versus Venlafaxine in combination with psychotherapy - study protocol for a randomized clinical trial,"Background: Sufficient evidence is lacking to draw final conclusions on the efficiency of medical and psychological treatments of traumatized refugees with PTSD. The pharmacological treatments of choice today for post-traumatic stress disorder are antidepressants from the subgroup selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, especially Sertraline. The evidence for the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the treatment of complex post-traumatic stress disorder in traumatized refugees is very limited. Venlafaxine is a dual-action antidepressant that works on several pathways in the brain. It influences areas in the brain which are responsible for the enhanced anxiety and hyper-arousal experienced by traumatized refugees and which some studies have found to be enlarged among patients suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.Design: This study will include approximately 150 patients, randomized into two different groups treated with either Sertraline or Venlafaxine. Patients in both groups will receive the same manual-based cognitive behavioral therapy, which has been especially adapted to this group of patients. The treatment period will be 6 to 7 months. The trial endpoints will be post-traumatic stress disorder and depressive symptoms and social functioning, all measured on validated ratings scales. Furthermore the study will examine the relation between a psycho-social resources and treatment outcome based on 15 different possible outcome predictors.Discussion: This study is expected to bring forward new knowledge on treatment and clinical evaluation of traumatized refugees and the results are expected to be used in reference programs and clinical guidelines.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01569685. © 2013 Sonne et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",512,Exclude,2013,Article,Study design
"World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of anxiety, obsessive-compulsive and post-traumatic stress disorders - First revision","In this report, which is an update of a guideline published in 2002 (Bandelow et al. 2002, World J Biol Psychiatry 3:171), recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are presented. Since the publication of the first version of this guideline, a substantial number of new randomized controlled studies of anxiolytics have been published. In particular, more relapse prevention studies are now available that show sustained efficacy of anxiolytic drugs. The recommendations, developed by the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) Task Force for the Pharmacological Treatment of Anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive and Post-traumatic Stress Disorders, a consensus panel of 30 international experts, are now based on 510 published randomized, placebo- or comparator-controlled clinical studies (RCTs) and 130 open studies and case reports. First-line treatments for these disorders are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and the calcium channel modulator pregabalin. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are equally effective for some disorders, but many are less well tolerated than the SSRIs/SNRIs. In treatment-resistant cases, benzodiazepines may be used when the patient does not have a history of substance abuse disorders. Potential treatment options for patients unresponsive to standard treatments are described in this overview. Although these guidelines focus on medications, non-pharmacological were also considered. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and other variants of behaviour therapy have been sufficiently investigated in controlled studies in patients with anxiety disorders, OCD, and PTSD to support them being recommended either alone or in combination with the above medicines.",543,Exclude,2008,Article,Review
Tolerance and efficacy of sodium oxybate in childhood narcolepsy with cataplexy: A retrospective study,"Narcolepsy with cataplexy is a sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, irresistible sleep episodes, and sudden loss of muscle tone (cataplexy) mostly triggered by emotions. Narcolepsy with cataplexy is a disabling lifelong disorder frequently arising during childhood. Pediatric narcolepsy often results in severe learning and social impairment. Improving awareness about this condition increases early diagnosis and may allow patients to rapidly access adequate treatments, including pharmacotherapy and/or non-medication-based approaches. Even though children currently undergo pharmacotherapy, data about safety and efficacy in the pediatric population are scarce. Lacking international guidelines as well as drugs registered for childhood narcolepsy with cataplexy, physicians have no other alternative but to prescribe in an off-label manner medications identical to those recommended for adults. We retrospectively evaluated 27 children ranging from 6 to 16 years old, suffering from narcolepsy with cataplexy, who had been treated with off-label sodium oxybate and had been followed in a clinical setting. Throughout a semi-structured interview, we documented the good efficacy and tolerability of sodium oxybate in the majority of the patients. This study constitutes a preliminary step towards a further randomized controlled trial in childhood narcolepsy with cataplexy.",490,Exclude,2012,Article,Disease
Time to relapse after 6 and 12 months' treatment of generalized anxiety disorder with venlafaxine extended release,"Context: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a chronic disorder in need of reliable data to guide long-term treatment. Objectives: To assess the benefits of 6 and 12 months' treatment of GAD with venlafaxine hydrochloride extended release (XR) in patients who improved after 6 months' open-label venlafaxine XR treatment. Design: After 6 months' open-label venlafaxine XR treatment, improved patients were randomized to venlafaxine XR or placebo for 6 months. All venlafaxine XR patients still in the study at 12 months were randomized to receive venlafaxine XR or placebo, and all placebo patients continued taking placebo for another 6 months. Setting: One urban site (5 locations). Patients: Of 268 patients with a diagnosis of GAD entering the open-label venlafaxine XR treatment phase, 158 (59.0%) completed 6 months, and 136 (50.7%) entered relapse phase 2 (6-12 months). Fifty-nine (43.4%) of 136 patients entered phase 3 (12-18 months). Intervention: Six months' open-label treatment with venlafaxine XR, followed by double-blind venlafaxine XR or placebo for 2 relapse phases, each lasting 6 months. Main Outcome Measures: Time to relapse while receiving venlafaxine XR or placebo after 6 and after 12 months of treatment. Relapse was strictly defined to safeguard against assigning patients with venlafaxine XR discontinuation symptoms or temporary anxiety increase as relapse. Results: For objective 1, relapse rates in phase 2 (months 6-12) were 9.8% on venlafaxine XR and 53.7% on placebo (P < .001). For objective 2, relapse rates after 12 months on placebo (32.4%) were lower than after 6 months on venlafaxine XR (53.7%) (P < .03). Conclusions: Treatment of GAD with an antidepressant should be continued for at least 12 months. Preliminary data demonstrate that improved patients who relapse while off their antianxiety medication after at least 6 months of treatment will again most likely respond to a second course of treatment with the same medication.

The long-term effect of trauma history on adolescent depression treatment,"BACKGROUND: Childhood trauma is associated with the development of depression during adolescence. Prior research suggests that traumatic experiences may result in differential acute treatment outcomes for depressed adolescents. However, the long-term effects of trauma on treatment response remain unclear. METHOD: Participants (N = 318) with a primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups: cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), fluoxetine (FLX), or their combination (COMB). All participants received 36 weeks of active treatment followed by 1 year of open follow-up. We hypothesized that (a) adolescents without a trauma history would have greater symptom reduction over the course of treatment compared to those with a trauma history and (b) there would be an interaction between trauma history, treatment arm, and time such that adolescents without trauma histories in combination treatment would improve the most rapidly. Linear mixed effects modeling, factorial ANOVAs, and log-linear analyses were used to test these hypotheses. RESULTS: The linear mixed effect model revealed a significant 3-way interaction of time, trauma, and treatment type. In the CBT and COMB groups, adolescents without trauma histories improved more rapidly than traumatized adolescents. In the single-time-point analyses, there were no significant differences between adolescents with trauma histories and those without trauma histories. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas all treatment groups experienced significant reductions in depression regardless of trauma history, adolescents without trauma histories receiving psychotherapy demonstrated more rapid improvements in depression symptom severity. Treatment response did not differ between traumatized and nontraumatized youth at long-term follow-up.

The impact of mental illness and psychotropic medications on sexual functioning: The evidence and management (CME),"Background. Sexual dysfunction (SD) occurs frequently in patients with psychiatric illness. Methods. The published literature on SD in patients with a psychiatric illness and/or taking psychotropic medications was reviewed. Results. SD prevalence and type was found to vary with the specific psychiatric illness and medication treatment. Assessment is complicated by the presence of preexisting or comorbid sexual disorders or medical illness affecting sexual function. Direct questioning about sexual function before treatment and throughout the course of therapy is essential to establish baseline sexual functioning, patient preferences regarding medication side effects, and to identify medication-associated SD. A limited number of management strategies for SD in psychiatric patients have been systematically studied. Conclusions. SD with psychiatric illness and its treatment requires early identification, and incorporation of patient preferences for successful management. © 2009 International Society for Sexual Medicine.",466,Exclude,2009,Article,Review
The Impact of Ketamine for Treatment of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder: A Systematic Review With Meta-Analyses,"Background: Ketamine has been used in anesthesia, pain management, and major depressive disorder. It has recently been studied in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Objective: To determine the impact of ketamine on PTSD symptomatology and depression scores. Methods: We conducted a literature search of Medline 1960 to May 20, 2023, and found 6 randomized controlled trials that met our inclusion criteria. We extracted data on the Clinician-Administered PTSD (CAPS), PTSD Checklist (PCL), or Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating (MADRS) scales. Results: The use of ketamine significantly reduced CAPS scores (n = 5, MD: −10.63 [95% CI −14.95 to −6.32]), PCL scores (n = 3, MD: −6.13 [95% CI −8.61 to −3.64]), and MADRS scores (n = 3, MD: −6.33 [95% CI −8.97 to −3.69]) at the maximal follow-up times versus control. Significant benefits were found at day 1 and weeks 1, 2, and 4 for CAPS and PCL scores as well as MADRS scores at day 1, week 1, and week 4 for ketamine versus control. The time to PTSD relapse was prolonged in the patients receiving ketamine versus control (n = 2, 15.74 days [95% CI 3.57 to 29.91 days]). More dry mouth (n = 2, OR 5.85 [95% CI 1.32 to 25.95]), dizziness (n = 2, OR 3.83 [95% CI 1.28 to 11.41]), and blurred vision (n = 2, OR 7.57 [1.00 to 57.10]) occurred with ketamine than control therapy. Conclusions and Relevance: Ketamine modestly reduced PTSD and depression scores as early as 1 day of therapy, but the longevity of effect needs to be determined. Given similar magnitude of benefit with SSRIs and venlafaxine, ketamine would not supplant these traditional options for chronic use.",465,Exclude,2023,Article in Press,Language
